# its-crewed
A crawler that looks for non-inclusive words in recent news articles and blog posts, then emails the writer with a polite invitation to fix the text.

This is a work in progress.

If you want to contribute, these are some of the tasks ahead:

**TODO**
* Collect non-inclusive/inclusive word pairs.
* Write the reasoning behind each pair. A paragraph to be sent in the email;
* Write the common parts of the email. Text that are not specific to any particular word, that'll be sent with the more specific explanations about the offenses found on the text;
* The crawler itself (maybe headless Chrome?);
* The emailer

I can't give a whole lot of time to this project, but I truly love the idea, so I will be thinking about it and experimenting with possibilities in a regular basis. If you have suggestions about the architecture, the behavior of the robot, tools that might facilitate building it, please get in touch here on GitHub or by any of these means:
